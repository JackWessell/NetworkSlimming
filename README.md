# NetworkSlimming
A self-study into the field of efficient machine learning and model deployment methodologies. The pipeline trains a ResNet model with layer-level knowledge distillation, performs channel-level pruning, and finally quantizes the model to 8-bit integer precision. The model is then deployed using Nvidia's TensorRT to be used as an inference engine.
